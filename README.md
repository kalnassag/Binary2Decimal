# Binary to Decimal Converter

This is my attempt at providing the solution for the [Bin2Dec](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md) challenge.

The limitations were:
* I could not use arrays to store the binary number, so I looped through the input as a string using the foreach statement for each character.
* I could use only one mathematical function, which was the Math.Pow for me.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
-   [ ] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
-   [ ] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can enter a variable number of binary digits
